              <li>A Finance major with a Business Analytics minor at Florida Southern College — currently based in Orlando, FL.</li>
              <li>I’m currently a Project Coordinator (Strategy & Hospitality Development) at Herschend Family Entertainment, where I help shape resort strategy, guest experience, and insights initiatives across the portfolio.</li>
              <li>Current NCAA swimmer at FSC — a conference finalist and SSC Commissioner’s Honor Roll student.</li>
              <li>I’m passionate about where finance, operations, and strategy meet, and I enjoy turning insights into clear decks, stronger rollouts, and data-driven decisions.</li>
              <li>Tools I use regularly: Excel, Power BI, Tableau, Smartsheet, Keynote, Microsoft Project, SQL (basic) — depending on the project.</li>
              <li>Long-term, I’m looking to keep growing in strategy, finance, and data-driven problem solving — and to keep contributing to meaningful, high-impact work.</li>

<!-- 
    <p>I’m a Senior at Florida Southern College pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Finance with a minor in Business Analytics at the Barney Barnett School of Business and Free Enterprise. I’m currently a Project Coordinator Intern at Herschend Family Entertainment, where I’m gaining hands-on experience in project planning, cross-team collaboration, and strategic development across hospitality and entertainment assets.

I also compete as a swimmer on the Florida Southern College team. Being a student-athlete has taught me valuable lessons in discipline, time management, and teamwork—skills I apply daily in both academic and professional settings.
